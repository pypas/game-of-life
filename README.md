# Rules

1. Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors becomes dead, because of underpopulation

2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive, because its neighborhood is just right

3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors becomes dead, because of overpopulation

4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive, by reproduction
